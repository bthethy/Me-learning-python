Customer Network Audit 

The script performs a netowrk audit for customer interfaces, and returns information about the interface, allocated IP address, as well as any static routes/BGP prefixes, and other related information.

Currently only works on Juniper routed ports
Limited IPv6 support

This is a small project as part of my python studies. More updates to follow.
